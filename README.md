# pydvorak
A Python curses application to help teach typing in Dvorak.

Heat Maps it should do:

-  Keep precise score of each keypress
-  Determine what letters you are weak at
-  Allow the user to specify what letters he'd like to learn
-  Persist scores and historical data
-  Manually configurable timeout so we don't skew the records when they go afk

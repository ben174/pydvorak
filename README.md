# pydvorak
A Python curses application to help teach typing in Dvorak.



## It should:

-  Keep precise score of each keypress
-  Determine what letters you are weak at
-  Allow the user to specify what letters he'd like to learn
-  Persist scores and historical data
-  Manually configurable timeout so we don't skew the records when they go afk
-  Emulate Dvorak keymap so the user doesn't have to change their keymap.

## What makes Dvorak Awesome?

Dvorak remaps your traditional QWERTY keyboard to something that makes more sense for the English language.
Keys which are commonly used are moved to the home row. Keys which are less frequently used are moved to 
locations which are harder to reach.
